Rodati-template
===============

This is a node.js project template created by the Rodati's developer team. The main purposes are:

- Serve as template/boilerplate for another (nodejs) projects
- Understand how a basic nodejs application works and the differences/similarities with another languages/projects
- Know the conventions (coding style, formats), common practices (patterns, solutions) and tools (frameworks, modules, libraries) used internally by the team
